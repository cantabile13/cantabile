Los Angeles is a sprawling Southern California city and the center of the nationâ€™s film and television industry. However, it has an issue going with its crime rate. This analysis covers the crime rate in Los Angeles.

><sub>Please note that this was a group project consisted of 4 people. My involvement was in all steps of the analysis, starting from cleaning the dataset, gathering more data to correlate, analysis using python, visualization in tableau, and compiling everything in the deck using canva. The final dataset consist of approximately 1M rows and 30 columns.</sub>

#### 1. Welcoming Page

<p style="font-size:12px">This is demo text</p>
Entering the visualization dashboard, I had made a welcoming page to create a brief explanation regarding our project background and goal. 

The visualization consists of two pages. The first is to sketch information from the dataset, visual exploration to gain insights/problems. While the second is to show the analysis on the dataset, and of course, the insights and recommendation.

The main dataset are all attained from public data (Lacity) combined with some supporting datasets from governmental website, demographical website, and even U.S. public data website.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques



### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
