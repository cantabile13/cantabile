## Analysis on L.A City Crime Rate

**Project description:** Los Angeles is a sprawling Southern California city and the center of the nationâ€™s film and television industry. However, it has an issue going with its crime rate. This analysis covers the crime rate in Los Angeles. Please note that this was a group project consisted of 4 people. My involvement was in all steps of the analysis, starting from cleaning the dataset, gathering more data to correlate, analysis using python, visualization in tableau, and compiling everything in the deck using canva. The final dataset consist of approximately 1M rows and 30 columns.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
